    153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

    Descriptionï¼š

    Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
    (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
    Find the minimum element.

    You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

    Example 1:
    Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
    Output: 1

    Example 2:
    Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
    Output: 0
